	<center><h3  style="font-size:20px"> I will story about my working experience. I start working when I in Diploma during semester break. That was my first working experience. I work at Pasaraya Tenten as a part-time for a month and a half at the end of the year. That for "BACK TO SCHOOL" campaign. A little bit excited because that was my first time. </h3> </center>

  <center><h3  style="font-size:20px"> My second experience also as a part-time in Pasaraya Tenten during semester break but this time not at the end of the year but during Ramadhan. At that time, actually I a little bit regret because I can't eat together with my family and "solat terawih". I was very sad at that time. Actually, at this momment all the part-time staff and permenant staff can't offday due to "HARI RAYA" campaign. </h3> </center>

  <center><h3  style="font-size:20px"> My third experience is after I end my diploma in hotel nearby my house which is Residence Inn Cherating. I part-time in account department. I key-in the data, bookeeping, collect the data history and several thing. Actually thathotel is my practical place. So I already know them. When I practical, I as housekeeping clerk in front office and housekeeping department.  </h3> </center>

  <center><h3  style="font-size:20px"> My fourth experience also in that hotel but during the Ramadhan. This time I'm not regret because I work only 3 days I think. So, I have time for eat with my family and "solat terawih". This time, I part-time in kitchen department which is in operation managemnet. That time, I work in kitchen and I serve a food because during Ramadhan that hotel open for event like everyday there was client who is booked for thier company. That was very tired because I did not have time to eat because we need to serve the food. It was like a buffet. </h3> </center>

  <center><h3  style="font-size:20px"> My last experience is before I start my Degree. 2 months I part-time in Pasaraya Ekonomi Berjaya. This place love so much event the work a little tough for me. But I make a new friends. Like a true friends because we still keep in touch untill now. Not like a other place. And you know what, I'm cried when I stop working there. Not only me, but the other staff too. That time was sooooo sad and I still remember their words. They said, "Ni kali pertama kita orang menangis sebab ada budak part-time nak berhenti kerja" and I'm very touched at that time. </h3></center>
