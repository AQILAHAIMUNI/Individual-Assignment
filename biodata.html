	<center><h2 style="font-size:40px">WHO IS SHE??</h2></center>

	<center><ul  style="font-size:20px"> I'm NUR AQILAH AIMUNI BT SALIM was born in Kuantan, Pahang. I'm a product of SMK Sultan Ismail Kemaman, Kolej Poly-Tech Mara Kuantan, and currently a Degree candidate in management at UiTM Kota Baru. My friends call me Aqilah, Qila, Qilah and Aimuni. Actually, only a Diploma time friend called me Aimuni. There is a story that actually happened why they called me Aimuni but let it be a secret. It's a little funny to remember about it actually but it's okay. It is a great memory to remember. I'm 24 years old. Oh My God, I'm old apparently hmmmm :'-) My special day is August 26. My birthplace is HTAA (Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan). My zodiac is Virgo.</ul> </center>

	<center><ul style="font-size:20px"> What is the nature of this Virgo zodiac person? Here some explanation of it. Virgo tends to be simple, practical, and analytical. Of course, they can also be very anxious, a little over-opinion, and sometimes perfectionist. In the case of romance just like last year all went well for Virgo. But, if you do not like the love life like last year, then this year you need to change some things, such as communicating well with your partner. Make whatever changes you need to make yourself happy. Virgo will have enough money to pay for all expenses and also have extra money to save. For a career, show more enthusiasm and confidence to your superiors. Share your ideas in a slightly louder voice and enter the role of leader if given the chance. Believe that you are more than ready to accept what job offers. It is very important to exercise often this year to keep Virgo healthy. </ul> </center>


	<center><ul style="font-size:20px"> I am a very confident person. I am confident that I will be able to do my best in whatever task is done if it is performed in the right way and accompanied by hard work. In addition, prayer is also a factor in one's success. Therefore, every effort taken must be embroidered with prayer and high commitment. I also like to do my tasks systematically. Therefore, I will carry out my daily activities based on the daily schedule that I have prepared. It also helps me manage time wisely because I always know what I need to do at certain times. Therefore, I can avoid wasting time. Furthermore, good time management is very important to me who bears the responsibility as a student.In my spare time, I enjoy reading books. Among the reading materials I chose were novels, magazines, and fiction books. I love reading because I get satisfaction when reading. </ul> </center>
