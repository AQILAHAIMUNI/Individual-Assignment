  <center><h4  style="font-size:20px"> This is my primary school. When I standard 1 untill standard 5, I stay in Kampung Padang Jaya, Kuantan. So I school at Sk Kampong Padang Kuantan. But when I standard 6, we moved because of family matter. My mom asking for transfer nearby with our hometown which is in Kemaman. Then her application accepted and we moved in Cherating Kuantan. Still in Kuantan but near with our hometown. So, I started school in Sk Cherating when I standard 6 and I still remembered that was tough for me to make a new friends. I cried everyday in class. When my friends ask me why, I said "owh, mata saya masuk habuk" hahahahaha then next day I still cried. It's hard for me because we are different language I think then they try to mocking every conversation I had. Some of them jelous of me I dont know why but they always looking for my fault for fighting but I was lucky because my mom was a teacher there. But I was not very lucky at all I think. Pffffttt </h4> </center>

   <center><h4  style="font-size:20px"> This is my secondary school. SMK Sultan Ismail Kemaman. I dont why, I dont like this school. Some of the teachers is bias. I dont like them. When I form 5, I took a chemistry subject and I was not good at that subject. Actually, I want to change the flow of accounting but my teacher does not share. So I had to take this subject. Back to my story, during that class my teacher always push me to answer the question. So that maked me so nervous and when I cant answer that, she scolded me in front of other students. Which I wonder, why always me. My other friends don't have to be like me. One day, I cried because she was too angry with me in front of other students. After I cried that say, she did not attacked me very much. He was more to ask me gently. </h4> </center>

  <center><h4  style="font-size:20px"> This is my college when I in Diploma. Quite fun here. Not quite but veryyyy fun. I found a lot of people from another country for the first time. Im very excited. Making a new friends, learn new knowledge, new environment. Actually very fun. Here I learn what life actually. Why learned, the aim, mission, vission, our goals. That was very fun for me. Involve with the technology and how to adapt it. Oh my god, I really miss it. My friends, my lecturer, my college, my hostel. Everything when in Kptm. That was very priceless momment. I wish I can turn back time. The best thing at that moment is my batch is the most batch of students and I dont know them hahahahaha. Because of that, our batch make a lot of event that encourage all student to join. </h4> </center>
